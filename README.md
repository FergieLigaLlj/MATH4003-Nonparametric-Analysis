Hello Everyone!
This is just my summary of the course assignment codes, which is required to be done by R.
Here is the **fundamental comprehension** of Nonparametric Analysis:
1. Nonparametric statistics is a type of statistical analysis that makes **minimal assumptions** about the underlying distribution of the data being studied.
2. Often these models are **infinite-dimensional**, rather than finite dimensional, as is parametric statistics.
