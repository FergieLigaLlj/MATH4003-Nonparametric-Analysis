### University of Macau CourseWork Project Code
### MATH4003 Nonparametric Analysis
### Pro. Liuzhi

Hello Everyone!
This is just my summary of the course assignment codes, which is required to be done by R.
Here is the **fundamental comprehension** of Nonparametric Analysis:
1. Nonparametric statistics is a type of statistical analysis that makes **minimal assumptions** about the underlying distribution of the data being studied.
2. Often these models are **infinite-dimensional**, rather than finite dimensional, as is parametric statistics.

### Course Outline: The objective of the course is to prepare the students for effective
    use of nonparametric statistics and to introduce some basic methods of nonparametric
    inference for statistical data analysis.
• Introduction/
• Rank methods for one-sample problem (The signed rank test)/
• Rank methods for two-sample problem (Wilcoxon rank-sum test)/
• Rank test for the one-way layout (Kruskal-Wallis test)/
• Linear regression and independence/
• Order statistics and related statistics, and their distributions/
• Robust estimates and related procedures/
• Goodness of fit test (Kolmogorov test)/
• Nonparametric curve estimation
